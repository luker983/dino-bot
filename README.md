# Dino Bot

A simple python bot that plays Google's offline dinosaur game

## Setup

First, make sure you have all necessary libraries installed. 
PIL is the main requirement. If the program fails due to a missing 
package, run:
```
pip3 install packagename
```
I used the website http://www.trex-game.skipser.com/ to do all of 
my testing, but this can be modified for any variation of the game. 
Next, figure out your coordinates. The bot.py file has several places 
where you need to enter in coordinates for your specific setup. 

## Running the Bot

```
python3 bot.py
```

## Tuning

My high score is 3,478, but your
mileage may vary. Adjusting the obstacle width and speed up factor is 
the best way to make small performance adjustments.

## Troubleshooting

Make sure all coordinates are correct. When screengrabbing for an obstacle
there should be only white when no obstacle is present. If you are still 
having issues, feel free to email me at lukerindels983@gmail.com. Thanks 
for playing!
